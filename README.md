# Simple Invoice CLI

## Philosophy
The idea for this app came to me while helping my dad with his company's billing process.\
I was manually creating recurring invoices in Excel, exporting them as PDFs, and sending them to customers on a monthly basis. Most of the steps were identical, with the only differences being the invoice number and the invoice date. I realized there had to be a better way to streamline this process by automating the PDF generation and email-sending tasks. So, I decided to put my software skills into practice and let the machine handle the work.


## Description

This script allows you to effortlessly create and email invoices as PDF files directly from your terminal.

### Prerequisites
- A PDF file containing your (corporate) invoice template.  
- Your email credentials, saved in a `.env` file in the root directory.

### How it Works
1. Run the `main.py` file in your terminal.  
2. The terminal will prompt you to enter an invoice number. This number will be added to a buffer together with the provided PDF invoice template.  

   _Note:_ The template is not included in the repository and must be added to the `_input` folder.  

3. The script automatically fetches the current date and adds it to the invoice buffer. Additionally, the billing period for the current month is printed on the invoice.  
4. A new invoice PDF is then generated from the buffer and saved in the `_output` folder.  

The positions of these strings (e.g., invoice number, date, billing period) can be adjusted to fit your invoice templateâ€™s layout.  

Finally, the program uses an automated function to send the generated invoice as an email attachment to a specified recipient. The recipient's email address, along with other credentials, must be stored in a `.env` file.  

### Customization Options
- You can modify the email body and the name of the attachment to suit your needs.
